	<p>	There are a number of stories as to the origin of the elves. The Hallstatt tradition maintains that they 
	were the original inhabitants of prehistoric Europe, but were gradually whittled down and driven northward 
	by the increasing number of humans. The Schwarzwald tradition claims that they were humans blessed by the 
	fae and charged with guarding Germania from Roman invaders. The Romantic tradition states that elves are 
	the pseudo-divine descendants of the Nephilim referenced in Genesis. It should be noted that the historians 
	of Effenmont neither acknowledge nor refute any of these theories.</p>
	
	<p>	Even before the elves entered the theatre of international politics, they were an exceptionally peaceful 
	and artistic society; leadership and law ranged from informal to nonexistent. 
	They did record their history in the form of woodcuts, though few survive and these are often vague. Set in 
	the middle of the North Sea, Effenmont fell victim to Viking raiders. By the 10th century, 10-30% of their population had been killed 
	or taken away. The elves contacted Celtic mercenaries from the British Isles for protection; some historians believe this act alluded to a prior relationship with the native Britons, though this is debatable. </p>
	
	<p>	The closest Effenmont ever came to civil war was during the Renaissance. The Druids preached a formalization of the druidic lifestyle; this included an aggressive stewardship of the land, refusal to take  an animal's life, and a curious blend of hedonism and asceticism. Something of a counter-movement arose in the form of the Hunter's Guild. The Hunter's Guild promoted artisanry and family values, but they also defended hunting as a necessary tradition. They nearly came to bloodshed, but civil war was averted when the monarchy made it clear that should violence ensue, the army would treat  members of both sides as hostile threats.</p>

	<p>	It has recently been made known that the ancient paramilitary group, the Paladins, have been reconvened and are active. Little is known about this organization; though their mission statement (preserve and cultivate elven culture and welfare) and warnings (don't threaten aforementioned mission) are public, their headquarters, membership, and operations are highly secretive.</p>
