	<p>	There are a number of stories as to the origin of the elves. The Hallstatt tradition maintains that they 
	were the original inhabitants of prehistoric Europe, but were gradually whittled down and driven northward 
	by the increasing number of humans. The Schwarzwald tradition claims that they were humans blessed by the 
	fae and charged with guarding Germania from Roman invaders. The Romantic tradition states that elves are 
	the pseudo-divine descendants of the Nephilim referenced in Genesis. It should be noted that the historians 
	of Effenmont neither acknowledge nor refute any of these theories.</p>
	
	<p>	Even before the elves entered the theatre of international politics, they were an exceptionally peaceful 
	and artistic society, albeit with much simpler lives. Leadership and law ranged from informal to nonexistent. 
	Aside from timber, which they harvested as rarely as possible, they had no abundant natural resources to speak of. 
	They did record their history in the form of woodcuts, though few survive and these are often vague. Set smack in 
	the middle of the North Sea, Effenmont fell victim to Viking raiders. Though proficient with a bow, the elves had 
	never been subject to large-scale conflict before. By the 10th century, 10-30% of their population had been killed 
	or enslaved by hostiles from Scandinavia. Though they had enjoyed spiritual unity, the clans recognized the need 
	to further unify under a single, organized government for defensive purposes. </p>
	
	<p>	Aranhil, a revered scholar from the central wood, was chosen by the clan leaders as High King of Effenmont. 
	His first act was to contact Celtic mercenaries from the British Isles for protection and instruction in the 
	art of self-defense; some historians believe this act alluded to a prior relationship with the native Britons, 
	though this is debatable. The elves had no inherent love for bloodshed, but their natural artistry lent itself 
	to forging, their agility, to swordplay. Though the mercenaries were formally dismissed after a short time, 
	many of them stayed; this  influence can be seen today. While humans call their red-haired people "redheads" or 
	"gingers," elves refer to their own redheads as "celts" or very occassionally "mercenaries." A few early elven 
	records were even in Pictish, instead of the native Alpien.</p>

	<!-- ! The discovery of celestial silver and the silverbell mine -->
	
	<p>	Religion as we think of it was largely absent from Effenmont up to this point. The priests of Thoggus, a cthonic sea-god, had been establishing a presence on the west coast. Granted, this entity had proven itself a boon in that it turned aside and sometimes even destroyed incoming raiders with storms. Despite this, the monarchy chose to discourage the growing cult, feeling that it was malicious and lent itself to fanaticism.</p>

	<!-- ! The plague - The rural lifestyle and cleanliness of elves didn't lend itself to the spread of the Black Death, and elven casualties were relatively low as a result. -->
	<!-- War of the Weeping Willow -->
	<!-- ! Alliance with FfF -->
	<!-- ! Policy of siring prominent elves -->

	<p>	A Peteran mission was built just outside of Calarost; the friars there didn't evangelize so much as offer their services in a more general way, which went over well with the elves. The Peterans and Effenmont began to rub off on each other. The missionaries adopted a nature-based view of God, coming to be stewards of His land as much as stewards of His people. Though converts remained a minority, it was a significant minority at one in four and many elves are Peterans to this day.</p>

	<!-- The Paladins and Druids fight off the Templars -->

	<p>	The closest Effenmont ever came to civil war was during the Renaissance. The Naturist movement, which was gaining momentum in Effenmont, preached a formalization of the druidic lifestyle; this included an aggressive stewardship of the land (even by elven standards), refusal to take  an animal's life, minimalist clothing, and a curious blend of hedonism and asceticism.</p>
	<p>	Something of a counter-movement arose in the form of the Hunter's Guild. They espoused a revitalization of the high points of elven culture over the past millenia whilst moving forward. The Hunter's Guild promoted artisanry and family values, but they also defended hunting, claiming not only was it tradition, but it was necessary, as the elven diet would provide little protein without meat to supplement it. The Naturists and Hunter's Guild nearly came to bloodshed over animal rights, but civil war was averted when the Queen made it clear that should violence ensue, the army would treat  members of both sides as hostile threats.</p>

		In 1892, Queen Elianne declared she would concede to a constitutional monarchy and establish a parliamentary civilian government. -->
	<!-- The abolishment of the caste system -->
	<!-- WW2 - ignored, sort of? sheltered the french -->
	<!-- Neo-nationalist movement -->
	<!-- Reforestation
		Not long after the conclusion of the Cold War, Parliament announced that it would be taking a number of measures to support reforestation in the central valley of the country. -->
	<p>	In 2008, it was announced in The Nightwatch that the ancient paramilitary group, the Paladins, had been reconvened and were active under the unofficial sanction of Her Majesty, the Queen of Effenmont. Little is known about this organization; though their mission statement (preserve and cultivate elven culture and welfare) and warnings (don't threaten aforementioned mission) are public, their headquarters, membership, and operations are highly secretive. Though the lion's share of their activity occurs on the North Sea, they have been reported as far away as Los Angeles.</p>
	<p>	The Paladins have a reputation for ruthless efficiency tempered by an almost British sense of humor. A wayward twenty-something named Lou Dellinger was causing a ruckus in elven neighborhoods at night. About a week or so into his vodka-fueled reign of narcissistic terror, he vanished. Half a year later he stumbled out of the Gobi Desert with a vacant expression and a Hello Kitty backpack full of Jack Links wrappers. He has not returned to Effenmont.</p>

Werewood was frequented for centuries by Native Americans, who established a game trail that is still either hunted or hiked, depending on where in the region you find yourself. 
Later longhunters would patrol the region as explorers began to appear in the area, leaving their homes for several months at a time to take advantage of the wild, unspoiled territory, with the fur trade being especially lucrative. 
Eventually farmers came and grew crops in the Downvalley, Old Victoria, and Skytop areas - a rough job to be sure, as the soil here is rocky. 
Shipping companies and small fishing operations moved in and there was some preliminary construction done on a fort, but support for the project was withdrawn. 
Before the army could scuttle it, however, an enterprising freedman named Venture Buckner had the idea of buying the land and half-finished fort, which the government sold for a song. 
He repurposed the fort into an iron forge, which wound up employing more than half the work force in town.

The Victorian age brought about the band saw; the lumber industry exploded and pushed into Werewood, doubling the town's population overnight. 
This era also brought about a heightened awareness of non-human sims, both scientifically and socially. The atmosphere was not friendly. 
Marston Maples was an entry-level grunt in a timber farming operation in the 1880s. His young wife Edna, a vampire, was murdered - poisoned by coworkers of his. 
Maples was heartbroken, but he was also ripshit pissed off (and, in retrospect, probably a little nanners), and went on a classic Old Testament killing spree, slaying and displaying the conspirators in ways that were ingenious in their creative sadism. 
He was hanged, naturally, but the town was so freaked out by these events that hostility towards vampires dropped to zero. This made Werewood a mecha for vampires. 
Exposure to vampires desensitized sims to their presence, which in turn brought in more supernaturals. 
It's ironic, how a hate crime of all things was the flap of the butterfly's wing that caused a hurricane. Werewood has been fifty years ahead of the curve on civil rights issues since Suffrage.

A hassle to reach by land and dangerous to reach by sea, Werewood's natural isolation was a blessing and a curse. 
On the one hand, the railroads never did manage to make it out here - a crippling disadvantage when the pulse of international commerce could be taken on a railroad tie. 
Salvation was found in the government's temporary lapse into insanity, also known as Prohibition. 
Hard to reach and forward-thinking, our forebears did exactly what you would expect thinking people to do: make moonshine, which they sold at ten prices. 
After the great war, the engineering society Tau Beta Pi recognized a need for education in Werewood, and gave the town a grant, a terrific burst of momentum, the effects of which can be seen today.
</p>
<p>
We're a happy, prosperous, welcoming town. People come for hiking, hunting, riding, and sport fishing, but really, we have a little of everything.
