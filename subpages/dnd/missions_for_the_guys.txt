ORLUMBOR
	Locals - Sheriff Dunwoody, Chloe, Ohm, Tailbones (Sentient Felid Abberation)

FOGHURST
	Ruled by a lord mayor who answers to a local noble. Its primary source of income is fishing, along with farming corn and wheat. They raise loads of pigs too.
	The bar and inn are built on a bridge over the river.
	There's a haunted tunnel that goes under the river that the locals don't know about.
	The green quarter gets its name for its lampposts with green glass. There was a mistake in the shipment from Baldur's Gate; one of the crates from the glass blower had green glass instead of colorless. The mayor was going to send it back, but the locals liked it so much they wound up keeping it.
	The veil between Faerun and the Feywild is especially thin in this area.
	Henry and Teresa Remington make +1 swords exclusively; they don't really have a storefront, but they do have showroom.
	Any houses or properties for sale?
	The Slaughtered Lamb, dive bar on the south side of town with a giant owl in a cage

PINEROSE
	A trading post for trappers, hunters, and rural artisans.
	The overall territory was contested, but the post itself was treated as neutral ground and an unaffiliated resource, so the nearby gnolls never caused trouble.

CALAROST
	Mostly wood elves, but the ruling caste is eladrin. Most of the de facto royalty are avariel.
