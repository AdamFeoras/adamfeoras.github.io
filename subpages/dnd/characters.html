				<img src="portraits/dane.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Dane Balcon</h3>
				<p>Like most tieflings, Dane has lived a lonely life of passive persecution. He's not at all malicious, but navigating a world hostile to the huge, curving horns of an antelope doesn't make one particularly compassionate, either. He made his own way as a kid, working for a pittance and sleeping in his places of work.</p>
				<p>Recently, his wards, the high elven Siannodel family, were killed in a raid on their caravan. They treated him like a close friend of the family and their death has sent him into a tailspin. It's not that he blames himself so much as that he's lost; they were his anchor in life, the source of his sense of purpose, the only people in the world who loved him. He's not sure where to go, what to think, or what to want in life, just a sorrowful leaf on the wind.</p>
				<p>The Siannodels instilled in Dane a sense of loyalty that serves as his moral compass. In a world that's unfriendly to you, your friends come before almost all other considerations.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Fighter, Sorceror (Abyssal), Monk</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: I would recommend a neutral alignment for Dane with a capacity to make the leap to good if he spends an extended period of time with a party: if he develops a sense of loyalty for his friends, he will likely come to value their ideals and naturally adopt them. I'm not sure if one would define him as lawful or chaotic; on the one hand, he doesn't place a lot of stock by the rules of society, but on the other hand, he has a strong personal code revolving around loyalty. Being a tiefling, I could definitely see him taking a level in sorceror, although I'm not sure 5e supports the abyssal bloodline yet. His trinket should be something from the Siannodels. If an opportunity to take another language arises, it might make sense for him to speak Elvish.</p>

				<h3>Felix Leopold</h3>
				<p>Felix was born to a human widow who had a whirlwind one-nighter with a mysterious elven nobleman. She was the owner of a run-down road tavern outside of Waterdeep called The Bleeding Cat, and while his mother didn't actively dislike him, to say that she was very fond of him would be untrue, and she was always busy, so he was more or less in charge of his own upbringing.</p>
				<p>And education. He found himself systematically learning from his mother's patrons, many of whom were charmed by this child's comfort with his edgy surroundings. History of a country here, background of a religion there, and so on. During this time he cultivated an innocent yet charismatic persona that made people inclined to confide in him. In his mid-teens, Felix had a fling with Westra, an Illuskan dhampir country lady. She was not a nice person, mostly used him for blood and other physical needs, but she gave him a crash course in illusion magic.</p>
				<p>Felix has a weakness for smoking. He's been known to light up in situations where stealth or formality was called for. He's not picky regarding the leaf in question. On the one hand, he's very streetsmart and good at sensing ulterior motives and cultivating trust. On the other hand, he's often too comfortable getting into trouble and has trouble reigning in his impulses.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Rogue, Wizard, Bard, Sorceror (Fey)</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: I wouldn't make him lawful or evil, but I don't have a strong opinion alignment-wise beyond that. Felix's father Davven is an eladrin emissary. Davven was consulting an oracle regarding his legitimate son, Felix's younger brother; when he asked after his son, the oracle asked, "Which one?" Now Davven is actively looking for him. He wants to take him to the Feywild and teach him the ways of their people.</p>

				<img src="portraits/markham.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Markham Chasseur</h3>
				<p>Markham's parents, Petrus and Janlynn Chasseur, raised him in Horsemash, a trading post in the High Forest for trappers, hunters, and rural artisans. The overall territory was contested, but the post itself was treated as neutral ground and an unaffiliated resource, so the nearby gnolls never caused trouble. This cosmopolitan, survivalist upbringing has given Markham an unflappable demeanor and an overdeveloped comfort with socially precarious situations.</p>
				<p>One day in the early morning hours, Markham was watching a landslide when he noticed a cougar kitten stranded on a boulder. He tried to reach her, but the slurry started again, taking him and washing his broken body into the lake below. However, by great good fortune, the eye of Oberon, the god king of the Seelie Fey, happened to be on him; touched by the hunter's selflessness, Oberon raised him and placed his mark on him.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Warlock (Archfey), Cleric (Oberon), Ranger, Druid</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Certainly good, probably chaotic. Probably speaks Sylvan, partly because of his relationship with Oberon, but mostly because the residents of Horsemash speak it as a kind of patois; elves, men, orcs, gnolls, halflings, and centaurs in the area usually speak at least a little Sylvan. If Markham were to become a ranger, it might be fitting for him to take a cougar as his companion animal. Dagnyr, the gnoll tanner in Horsemash, was savagely beaten, disfigured, and kicked out of the Blackfang clan for releasing captives when he was a pup. They left him for dead, but he survived, minus one eye, plus a limp and a mass of scar tissue. He hobbled to Horsemash, started a new life there, and became dear friends with the young Markham. The Blackfangs think Dagnyr is dead; if they found out he was alive and happy in Horsemash, there would be trouble. I've also considered making Dagnyr himself a player character.</p>

				<h3>Moxtmunthrek</h3>
				<p>The Amnish village of Kisanao was destroyed by the sahuagin, who were long gone before the bronze dragon Xiivairdaar arrived on the scene. Searching the burning ruins for survivors, he came upon a human male infant half-dead from smoke inhalation. Once the dragon was satisfied that the baby was the only one left, he flew to Rhymerock, a coastal fishing town he maintained a cordial relationship with and left the baby there.</p>
				<p>The boy grew to be a curious, sensitive intellectual who didn't particularly fit in with his own kind, frequently visiting Xiivairdaar in his sea cave home and staying there between living arrangements. When he was about four, the dragon realized he and the kid would be happier together, and embraced him as his son, naming him Moxtmunthrek - "tiny human" - though he goes by "Moxie."</p>
				<p>His father took charge of his education with both hands with respect to scholarship and practice, teaching him to fight, to dive for treasure, and to manipulate the natural magic of the sea. He especially focused on the history of warfare and the chivalrous traditions, encouraging Moxie to take up arms for noble causes, as he himself had done many times before.</p>
				<p>One day Moxie came home to discover that his father was gone - no explanation, no clues, nothing. He waited, fishing and reading for a week before he asked after him in Rhymerock, to no avail. After some time, he left a letter at home and set out to find his father.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Druid, Rogue, Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Definitely good alignment of some variety. Speaks Draconic. If he should become a druid, he would be one of the coastal specialty. Moxie never set out with ambitions of saving the world; the whole reason he wandered away from his home in the cave in the sea cliffs in the first place was because he was looking for his father. If he were to get scent of Xiivairdaar's trail, he'd have to be up to his waist in something important not to follow it.</p>

				<img src="portraits/mucksnipe.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Mucksnipe</h3>
				<p>Mucksnipe was born to a mousy farmer's daughter in Arinya, a farming town just north of Baldur's Gate. His father was the voracious marauder Whitehog, a ravenous ogre who terrorized the neighborhood for most of a year before vanishing. He ate loads of people and raped Mucksnipe's mother, who died giving birth to him in a fountain of blood.</p>
				<p>His uncle slapped him with the name after deciding not to bash his head against a rock. Dispassionately, he knows that Mucksnipe's a nice boy, but there's nothing dispassionate about how he thinks of Mucksnipe. From a young age, he made sure the half-ogre knew who his father was, what Mucksnipe's father did to his mother, what Mucksnipe did to his mother, and how close his uncle came to ridding the world of him for it. A lifetime of being subjected to this story filled the simple-minded Mucksnipe with shame, to the point where he couldn't bear to look at people and was prone to fits of self-loathing rage.</p>
				<p>He got a second job in his midteens playing bouncer at The Copper Crab, the tavern on the halfling side of town. Bree Tealeaf, a halfling priestess of Sheela took him under her wing after, eventually sheltering him from his abusive family. Her husband Roscoe was a hunter, and in their modest manor, they succeeded in partially rehabilitating his shame into determination to protect people.</p>
				<p>Click <a style="font-weight:bold;" onclick="myFunction()">HERE</a> for the 5e ogrillon race homebrew.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Barbarian, Ranger, Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: I would go chaotic for this character, probably chaotic good. Being an uneducated half-ogre, Mucksnipe is not a rocket scientist, so intelligence should be his lowest stat. If he goes the route of the ranger, he should take ogres as his favored enemy. Either way, I have a mental image of his foster mother's influence in his choice of weapon, the scythe. There is nothing that would bring Mucksnipe as much satisfaction as relieving Whitehog's shoulders of his head. If Whitehog were to reappear in the world, Mucksnipe would make a beeline for his father's new stomping grounds meaning to do some stomping of his own.</p>

				<img src="portraits/ronan.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Ronan Brandywine</h3>
				<p>Itmenixen was a red dragon who meant to raise a battalion of half-dragon children, and to this end he abducted female royals and noblewomen, raped them, and then ransomed them for mountains of gold after they gave birth. He lost interest in this plan and sold his children into slavery. An Orog warchief saw potential in Deevdrudiixen, a young male. He taught the half-dragon the ways of magic, and eventually the boy surpassed his master, joined up with the cult of Tiamat, had a baby through magical means, bailed on the mother, who raised him in the cult and abandoned him when he was five or so. From that point he made his way in the slums, an angry boy with a bright mind, working and sleeping in stables and kitchens, finding his way to the library when he had time.</p>
				<p>Ronan has a devil-may-care attitude and a zest for life, but if truth were to be told, he's deeply insecure, wounded by the multiple rejections of his forebears. He has a world-class chip on his shoulder and has a bone to pick with his parents, his grandfather, chromatic dragons in general, the cult of Tiamat, and the queen of dragons herself.</p>
				<p>He has some peculiar draconic traits. Like most red dragons, he has a thing for human and elven maidens, though this manifests itself in a heightened sex drive instead of dietary preference. But the most distinctive draconic trait is his desire to acquire treasure. He  talks a lot about acquiring an estate; this is partially for status, but mostly because he wants a place to hoard finery, trophies, and gold.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Wizard, Sorceror (Draconic), Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Definitely a chaotic type; probably not evil, but not by much. His vices are partially an outlet for his emotional injuries, so the only way I could see him becoming good is if he tackled the inferiority complex that rejection instilled in him. Though he is more or less human, bright red hair and irises would be a nice allusion to his biological grandfather. His extra language would be Draconic. If I were to roll amazing stats on this character, I would ask the DM to consider trading in a share of them to apply the half-dragon template to Ronan.</p>

				<img src="portraits/sighbiorn.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Sighbiorn Silverscale</h3>
				<p>Krahjoor-vahlok was a silver dragon who was condemned to live life as a human by Bahamut as an act of contrition for malicious hubris. He settled into the Cormyr region, married a kind woman, and raised a family. He owns a successful vineyard just up the road from Bahamut's temple. Most of his children and grandchildren work the vineyard and serve at the temple, and a number of them manifest the characteristics of draconic descent, one of them being Krahjoor-vahlok's grandson, Sighbiorn.</p>
				<p>Sibbe sometimes got on his siblings' nerves; he would wander into town and spend hours poring over books and maps at the library whilst they busted their asses in the vineyard. Sometimes his grandfather would join him and tutor him in subjects he took an interest in. Sibbe is friendly and cheerful, but naive and with an overdeveloped sense of fairness, naturally well-adjusted but with too much having been handed to him. Krahjoor-vahlok became increasingly aware of these shortcomings, so he began to train his grandson to fight with the sword and with the magic in his draconic blood, reminding him that the Lord of the North Wind listens to deeds, not words.</p>
				<p>One spring day the Cult of Tiamat attacked their homestead and got more than they bargained for from Krahjoor-vahlok's children. But they suffered a loss, Sibbe's little sister Elisiv, who they buried overlooking the vineyard with a sapling for a gravestone. Sighbiorn is a gentle man, but the loss of his baby sister has given him a determined retributive streak.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Sorceror (Draconic), Paladin (Bahamut), Cleric (Bahamut)</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: This character was very nearly a woman named Sibel, which would also work. Definitely lawful good and a friendly, cheerful type. A cool trinket would be something that recalls his heritage: one of his grandfather's old scales, a bottle of wine, maybe an old symbol of Bahamut, something. I was thinking of giving him a physical trait that alluded to his bloodline, like luminescent silver irises. His extra language would be Draconic. An alternate option is for him to have initiated the rite of rebirth and become a platinum dragonborn.</p>

				<img src="portraits/skari.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Sk&aacute;ri</i></h3>
				<p>This young man had the rare blessing of being raised on the Whalebone Islands, a human society where being a half-orc bastard was incidental; all they care for is bravery and diligence, and while his temper occasionally got him in trouble, he had friends and was well-thought of. His mother, Ylfva, a loving but severe woman, had him earning his keep as an assistant to Jakop the undertaker, at least when he wasn't earning his keep in their roots garden. It's hard to farm in the chilly, windy Whalebones, but the potatoes and carrots they grew were reliable and kept them fed.</p>
				<p>He was into his teenage years when one of the cadavers on Jakop's slabs sat up and ripped the undertaker's throat open. Sk&aacute;ri put the zombie down, but it was too late for his friend. He was disturbed by the emptiness of Jakop's demise. Katerin, a priestess of the Raven Queen, took him under her wing and taught him the balance and order that death brought to the world, that death was nothing to resent, fear, or to deal out lightly.</p>
				<p>Fascination crystalized into conviction as he internalized Katerin's stories and eventually took the vows of fealty to the Raven Queen, swearing to protect people, put down undead, and punish malicious hubris. Growing too big for home, Sk&aacute;ri got on a ship and set sail for the mainland.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Paladin (The Raven Queen), Cleric (The Raven Queen), Barbarian, Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Sk&aacute;ri is aware that half-orcs aren't widely embraced outside of his home, but he may not be prepared for the reality of those prejudices. Taking into account his orcish temper and the fact that he's accustomed to being evaluated fairly, this dynamic may queue him up for some explosive confrontations. Being a follower of the Raven Queen, Sk&aacute;ri is lawful. Probably good. Necessarily good, if he's a paladin. Like the goddess of death he serves, Sk&aacute;ri reserves a special hatred for the undead and other scions of Orcus.</p>
