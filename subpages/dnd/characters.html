				<h3>Sighbiorn Silverscale</h3>
				<h4>Human Male - Light Paladin of Bahamut - Lawful Good</h4>
				<p>Krahjoor-vahlok was a silver dragon who was condemned to live life as a human by Bahamut as an act of contrition for malicious hubris. He settled into the Cormyr region, married a kind woman, and raised a family. He owns a successful vineyard just up the road from Bahamut's temple. Most of his children and grandchildren work the vineyard and serve at the temple, and a number of them manifest the characteristics of draconic descent, one of them being Krahjoor-vahlok's grandson, Sighbiorn.</p>
				<p>Sibbe sometimes got on his siblings' nerves; he would wander into town and spend hours poring over books and maps at the library whilst they busted their asses in the vineyard. Sometimes his grandfather would join him and tutor him in subjects he took an interest in. Sibbe is friendly and cheerful, but naive and with an overdeveloped sense of fairness, naturally well-adjusted but with too much having been handed to him. Krahjoor-vahlok became increasingly aware of these shortcomings, so he began to train his grandson to fight with the sword and with the magic in his draconic blood, reminding him that the Lord of the North Wind listens to deeds, not words.</p>
				<p>One spring day the Cult of Tiamat attacked their homestead and got more than they bargained for from Krahjoor-vahlok's children. But they suffered a loss, Sibbe's little sister Elisiv, who they buried overlooking the vineyard with a sapling for a gravestone. Sighbiorn is a gentle man, but the loss of his baby sister has given him a determined retributive streak.</p>

				<h3>Qwinn Amastacia</h3>
				<h4>Wood Elf Female - Thief - Chaotic Good</h4>
				<p>Qwinn Amastacia was the only child born to The Duke and Duchess of Oakwood Kieran and Lyra Amastacia. Oakwood is a small Elvish town between a forrest and a freshwater river. The Amastacia estate lies at the top of the town, from their perch the Duke and Duchess look down their noses upon their people. The Duke and Duchess had hoped for a boy, so were understandably disappointed when Qwinn was born, especially when they later found that the Duchess was getting too old for another child. Their lineage was ruined, a fact Qwinn's parents were forcably reminded of each time they looked at her, so they avoided her at all costs, preferring instead to drink copious amounts of wine and discuss their latest purchases. Qwinn hated them.</p>
				<p>For the first 60 years of young Qwinns life she was passed from caretaker to caretaker, learning bits of information from each, one taught her basic longbow skills, another beginning geography, on and on it wentbut always within the iron gates of the mano. Qwinn yearned to see what lay beyond the sculpted topiaries of her families manicured gardens, as each dreary day crawled by. Her only friend, a kitchen boy named Froen. In her few moments away from her many tutors, she would go to the kitchens and hear Froen's tales of life outside the palace gates. He taught her things only street boys would know, like how to dupe royalty out of their money by a simple game of cups, or how to swipe a wallet. They even had a secret language that only they knew. He called it the Thieve's Cant or something...she couldn't quite remember. She always thought all this was just pretend...but he seemed to know what he was talking about. Each night he would go home to his family, and Qwinn would be left in her prision.</p>
				<p>One day, Froen never returned. She asked everyone she knew, the kitchen staff and her many tutors, and all she could find out is that his family moved away and that she would never see him again. It was the final straw. Her one comfort in the whole world was gone. She would plan her escape. She planned and plotted for months, finally, as her most recent warden (Amra or Elma...or something) failed to show the proper way to hold a rapier, Qwinn was able to sneak away to her room, fiegning a sickness. She threw on a heavy shawl, climbed down a trellis and through a weak point in the gate she had been eyeing for a week and a half. She ran for the woods, climbed a tree, wrapped herself with her shawl a little tighter, and waited for morning, and her adventure to begin.</p>
				<p>Morning came and Qwinn was off, running down to the nearby marketplace she had seen so many times from her little window. Never before had she seen such life, such color, so many wonderful people who held conversation about more than the trivalries of palace life. She thought to herself that she could stay here forever, in the whirling excitement of the marketplace. Curiously perusing stall after stall, this one selling cheeses, that one delicious smelling  breads that one sells herbs and potions and that one...Qwinn stopped. She noticed a stall hidden by the masses. It was darkened, covered by purple drapery. She wouldn't have noticed it if it werent for a flash of light catching her eye, as if the sun had reflected off of a surface of some kind.</p>
				<p>Intrigued, she was drawn to the small stall. Pulling back the drapery, she entered the stall to see beautifully intricate glass sculpures of men and dwarves, elves and wizards, so lifelike it seemed as if they had been breathing but moments ago. Somehow she was pulled towards a figurine towards the very back of the stall...a small bird in a cage, the detail so immaculate you could see each individual feather, and a look of, almost hopelessness in its tiny black eyes. Qwinn felt compelled to touch just one of the minuscule feathers...just to prove it was in fact glass...and with that one touch the figuring shattered into a million pieces witht the sound of wind through a chandelier..."...You shouldn't have done that" a voice croaked from behind her. She whipped around apologizing profusely making up excuses and babbling like an idiot to the old woman who suddenly appeared in the stall less than five feet from where she was standing. How the hell did I not hear her come in Qwinn wondered. "...a hundred years..." the woman spoke again. "...mine for a hundred years..."</p>
				<p>Qwinn terrified and confused apologized again, making up some sort of excuse for leaving in such a hurry and ran out the door...or tried to. Not 50 yards away from the stall Qwinn was yanked backwards from the neck, causing her to cry out silently in alarm, and fall to her knees. She noticed the men and women at the market with fearful expressions gathering their children and hurrying off to safety. Qwinn tried to yell for help, but couldn't make a sound, she raised shaky hands to her neck, where she felt a thick iron collar. Turning around quickly, Qwinn looked back at the stall from which she came. A sturdy iron chain ran from her neck to the old womans hand. "You're mine now." The woman sneered suddenly seeming a lot less old and frail. "Come." Qwinn felt her feet move below her as if on their own accord, she tried desperately to stop pulling at her own legs, trying to yell for help, trying anything...but it was no use. Qwinns face fell and she slowly realized this old woman was much more than she seemed. Qwinn was hers. Her freedom lasted only a mere 16 hours, she traded her family's prison for one of this old witch's making. Horrifed she remembered what the woman had mumbled earlier...100 years.... This would be her fate 100 years.... The old woman smiled.</p>
				<p>And so it went for a hundred years. The old womans name, Qwinn found out, was Morgana Crane, known for loving no man woman or child, only the feel of a gold coin between her fingers. Qwinn spent the next hundred years with Morgana, traveling from market to market swindling the common people of their hard earned money. Qwinn was doomed to follow any order, throughout her years as Morganas slave Qwinn found herself stealing from innocent people, and punishing those who wronged her master. Once, and this still haunts her to this day, she was told to drown a boy, no more than twelve, for pinching a tiny glass marble. And so it went on, weary year after weary year.</p>
				<p>There were days that Qwinn thought she would just give up, what good was a life after this, after all she had done to these poor innocent people...she resolved that if she made it out of her slavery alive, she would undo the wrong she had done to these people. The days wore on, days turned to weeks, weeks turned to months, moths turned to years, years turned to decades.</p>
				<p>One night, after what seemed like lfietimes, Qwinn woke in the night. At firt she assumed her master wanted something but she wasn't made to go to her, she just sat there. Confused, at why she awoke so suddenly, she looked around and noticed something was off...she couldn't quite place it...until it hit her. The chain. It. Was. Gone. The hundred years were up...and Morgana hadnt noticed yet. With this realization, Qwinn stared in stunned silence. The time was now. She had to go. Move. She told herself forcefully...and for the first time in a hundred years, Qwinn took a step that was entirely her own. She ran long and far, using the skills she had learned as a young girl from Froen the kitchen boy, the only friend she ever knew.</p>
				<p>She overheard one night that as soon as Morgana had found her gone, she had burned down 5 towns, and was on the look out for her. Qwinn's skills from Froen and from her many tutors proved useful, she found herself turning into a Robin Hood of sorts, robbing the rich to feed the poor. She was living the life she had always wanted, free of any prison, able to do as she pleased in any manner she pleased. She grew to enjoy a good ale, and cultivated a fondness for whiskey. Qwinn could finally help those who needed it, and made valuable friends of the village people. Most nights you could find her, spinning yarns in a tavern somewhere, with a smile on her face, and eyes that have seen more than any girl ever should. Eyes that knew fear...because all the while, Morgana was still coming...</p>

				<h3>Hobson</h3>
				<h4>Male Halfling - Barbarian</h4>
				<p>Hobson is a young halfling on the small side. Standing just at 3 feet and weighing just under 40lbs. His parents disappeared into the woods when he was very young. He has dreams of seeing them dragged by a dark figure into a portal. He started developing a temper from an early age and began to lose control of it soon after, screaming demons were coming to kill him, and when he went into his fits hes was virtually unstoppable (even as a child). Everyone put up with it for years and felt sorry for the orphan kid with PTSD.</p>
				<p>One night he dreams a demon is trying to pull him under his bed and he goes into a rage and the demon fights back with fire. Destroying several shops in the shire. No one believes him that it was a demon and he is blamed for the fires. The next morning during the council meeting determining his future he voluntarily leaves his shire. The Council Elder who always had a soft spot for him gave him an ancient book owned by his mother to pay his way into Candlekeep. The tome is magically locked but he can hear something humming inside.</p>
				<p>Left for Candlekeep where he knew his uncle, Tate, was a monk; he in turn became a Monk of Candlekeep. Studied the lore, creatures, heroes, languages and gateways to the other planes under his uncle's tutelage. Tate is almost obsessive about other planes and finding a gate but, is terrified to leave the keep. Decades pass in the windowless caverns and libraries of the keep without dreams of demons or rage.</p>
				<p>One day Tate did not show up for lesson, he was gone for 5 days. On the fifth day he returned near dead clutching the ancient book. Tate tells Hobson his parents are trapped on another plane, inside this book is the key to the gate to take him there but he can't go alone and he needs to become powerful enough to cast a spell capable of traveling across planes. Hands Hobson the book and a letter which is a manuscript on the celestial language and instructions on how to open the tome. Additionally he is told he is no longer safe at the keep and he must leave. The creatures of the other plane have locked onto the tuning fork.</p>
				<p>He then departs Candlekeep and out into the world. Introduces himself as a Monk of Candlekeep to all strangers saying he's doing field research and seeking strong companions to aide him. He will try extremely hard to never rage and will not until it's a life or death situation. Always want to see how things work. He has read about everything and is very excited to see it all for real now. Will go anywhere, try anything and talk to anyone without fear, just curiosity.</p>

				<h3>Kelric Haleson</h3>
				<h4>Half-Elf Male - Fiendish Warlock</h4>
				<p>He grew up alone with his father in the small town of Westrun with his father Emmett Haleson. He spent up until the age eleven in this village until goblins attacked his village and a goblin war boss slaughtered his father in the streets. It was then that a voice echoed in his head telling him he could get revenge for his fathers death and strike out against this creature. He doesn't remember what he promised but he got his powers and hurled the goblin through into the planes of the fiend that gave Kelric his powers. It was then the soldiers pushed back through the town and repelled the goblin invaders. Kelric never leaned the identity of this demon and the only evidence of its passing is the powers that have been developing in him and the occasional feeling of a presence during times of stress and tension.</p>
				<p>Hearing of the fathers death, Kelrics mother Elora Shattersong came to the village and collected him, bringing him to the Elven village of Orvadell. Kelric spent the rest of his short childhood resenting his cold and distant surroundings as the Elves looked down on his half blood heritage. He did his best to hide his powers from everyone around him and told no one of what really happened that day.</p>
				<p>When he turned 18 he traveled to the town of Neverwinter and joined the calligraphers guild Redmantle. A powerful faction that enchants scrolls and tomes as well as draws up contracts both magically binding contracts and law binding contracts for the higher tiers of society. Kelric spent the next several years of his life embedding himself into the local church to Tymora, goddess of luck, and raising his position in the guild. During these years, he assembles his tome with powerful magic inks taken from the guild here and there to hold his new spells. It is a large blue book with silver trimmings and symbols of various gods and goddesses with a large symbol of Tymora in the middle. (A shining featureless Disk of silver). It's pages are thick high quality vellum and enchanted to prevent wear during travel. As well, he learned abyssal in the hopes of one day confronting this demon who gave him so much to hide from the world.</p>
				<p>He made few friends outside of these places and just recently has been feeling a wanderlust that he cannot explain. It came to him one day, out of the blue, that he should ask for a grant to travel around the sword coast seeking out rare texts, magical and non-magical alike. This intrigued the guild masters as they knew him as the hard working and completely pious Kelric who could do things with cleric magic they hadn't seen before (as he was a warlock). With this in mind, they gave him permission to travel as long as one day he returned with the books for their collection. Knowing he would need more than the 32 gold they gave him to start off, Kelric began looking for odd jobs and powerful traveling companions to aid him in his quest.</p>

				<h3>Oberon the Boneless</h3>
				<h4>Male Eladrin - Bard</h4>
				<p>Oberons birth was the first tragedy of his life. His mother died giving birth to him, and his father, upon seeing Oberons horribly mishapen leg, abandoned him in the heart of the wilderness. After a time he was stumbled upon by a group of Dryads who were living in a nearby grove. The first portion of his life was spent being raised by the Dryads, who protected him from the creatures of the wild and introduced him to many of the fey creatures of the wild. Oberons greatest friend as a child was a satyr who taught him to speak sylvan and how to play the pan flute. By the time he had grown to maturity his musical abilities had surpassed that of the fey creatures. He soon realized that he was able to imbue his music with magic. Growing restless in the confines of the Dryad grove, Oberon prayed to Titania, fey goddess of Magic. He prayed for the power to be able to walk, so that he might explore and share his music with the world. His prayer was answered in the most unlikely of ways. an acorn. Oberons most prized possession, he keeps the acorn always on his person on a chain arond his neck. If he ever removes the acorn his leg returns to its crippled state.</p>
				<p>Having recieved Titania's blessing, Oberon left the grove. Promising the Fey creatures that he would one day return. Now Oberon travels the world, telling tales, sharing his music and looking for adventure.</p>

				<img src="portraits/dane.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Dane Balcon</h3>
				<p>Like most tieflings, Dane has lived a lonely life of passive persecution. He's not at all malicious, but navigating a world hostile to the huge, curving horns of an antelope doesn't make one particularly compassionate, either. He made his own way as a kid, working for a pittance and sleeping in his places of work.</p>
				<p>Recently, his wards, the high elven Siannodel family, were killed in a raid on their caravan. They treated him like a close friend of the family and their death has sent him into a tailspin. It's not that he blames himself so much as that he's lost; they were his anchor in life, the source of his sense of purpose, the only people in the world who loved him. He's not sure where to go, what to think, or what to want in life, just a sorrowful leaf on the wind.</p>
				<p>The Siannodels instilled in Dane a sense of loyalty that serves as his moral compass. In a world that's unfriendly to you, your friends come before almost all other considerations.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Fighter, Sorceror (Abyssal), Monk</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: I would recommend a neutral alignment for Dane with a capacity to make the leap to good if he spends an extended period of time with a party: if he develops a sense of loyalty for his friends, he will likely come to value their ideals and naturally adopt them. I'm not sure if one would define him as lawful or chaotic; on the one hand, he doesn't place a lot of stock by the rules of society, but on the other hand, he has a strong personal code revolving around loyalty. Being a tiefling, I could definitely see him taking a level in sorceror, although I'm not sure 5e supports the abyssal bloodline yet. His trinket should be something from the Siannodels. If an opportunity to take another language arises, it might make sense for him to speak Elvish.</p>

				<img src="portraits/felix.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Felix Leopold</h3>
				<p>Felix was born to a human widow who had a whirlwind one-nighter with a mysterious elven nobleman. She was the owner of a run-down road tavern outside of Waterdeep called The Bleeding Cat, and while his mother didn't actively dislike him, to say that she was very fond of him would be untrue, and she was always busy, so he was more or less in charge of his own upbringing.</p>
				<p>And education. He found himself systematically learning from his mother's patrons, many of whom were charmed by this child's comfort with his edgy surroundings. History of a country here, background of a religion there, and so on. During this time he cultivated an innocent yet charismatic persona that made people inclined to confide in him. In his mid-teens, Felix had a fling with Westra, an Illuskan dhampir country lady. She was not a nice person, mostly used him for blood and other physical needs, but she gave him a crash course in illusion magic.</p>
				<p>Felix has a weakness for smoking. He's been known to light up in situations where stealth or formality was called for. He's not picky regarding the leaf in question. On the one hand, he's very streetsmart and good at sensing ulterior motives and cultivating trust. On the other hand, he's often too comfortable getting into trouble and has trouble reigning in his impulses.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Rogue, Wizard, Bard, Sorceror (Fey)</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: I wouldn't make him lawful or evil, but I don't have a strong opinion alignment-wise beyond that. Felix's father Davven is an eladrin emissary. Davven was consulting an oracle regarding his legitimate son, Felix's younger brother; when he asked after his son, the oracle asked, "Which one?" Now Davven is actively looking for him. He wants to take him to the Feywild and teach him the ways of their people.</p>

				<img src="portraits/markham.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Markham Chasseur</h3>
				<p>Markham's parents, Petrus and Janlynn Chasseur, raised him in Horsemash, a trading post in the High Forest for trappers, hunters, and rural artisans. The overall territory was contested, but the post itself was treated as neutral ground and an unaffiliated resource, so the nearby gnolls never caused trouble. This cosmopolitan, survivalist upbringing has given Markham an unflappable demeanor and an overdeveloped comfort with socially precarious situations.</p>
				<p>One day in the early morning hours, Markham was watching a landslide when he noticed a cougar kitten stranded on a boulder. He tried to reach her, but the slurry started again, taking him and washing his broken body into the lake below. However, by great good fortune, the eye of Oberon, the god king of the Seelie Fey, happened to be on him; touched by the hunter's selflessness, Oberon raised him and placed his mark on him.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Warlock (Archfey), Cleric (Oberon), Ranger, Druid</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Certainly good, probably chaotic. Probably speaks Sylvan, partly because of his relationship with Oberon, but mostly because the residents of Horsemash speak it as a kind of patois; elves, men, orcs, gnolls, halflings, and centaurs in the area usually speak at least a little Sylvan. If Markham were to become a ranger, it might be fitting for him to take a cougar as his companion animal. Dagnyr, the gnoll tanner in Horsemash, was savagely beaten, disfigured, and kicked out of the Blackfang clan for releasing captives when he was a pup. They left him for dead, but he survived, minus one eye, plus a limp and a mass of scar tissue. He hobbled to Horsemash, started a new life there, and became dear friends with the young Markham. The Blackfangs think Dagnyr is dead; if they found out he was alive and happy in Horsemash, there would be trouble. I've also considered making Dagnyr himself a player character.</p>

				<img src="portraits/moxtmunthrek.png" class="portrait"/>
				<h3>Moxtmunthrek</h3>
				<p>The Amnish village of Kisanao was destroyed by the sahuagin, who were long gone before the bronze dragon Xiivairdaar arrived on the scene. Searching the burning ruins for survivors, he came upon a human male infant half-dead from smoke inhalation. Once the dragon was satisfied that the baby was the only one left, he flew to Rhymerock, a coastal fishing town he maintained a cordial relationship with and left the baby there.</p>
				<p>The boy grew to be a curious, sensitive intellectual who didn't particularly fit in with his own kind, frequently visiting Xiivairdaar in his sea cave home and staying there between living arrangements. When he was about four, the dragon realized he and the kid would be happier together, and embraced him as his son, naming him Moxtmunthrek - "tiny human" - though he goes by "Moxie."</p>
				<p>His father took charge of his education with both hands with respect to scholarship and practice, teaching him to fight, to dive for treasure, and to manipulate the natural magic of the sea. He especially focused on the history of warfare and the chivalrous traditions, encouraging Moxie to take up arms for noble causes, as he himself had done many times before.</p>
				<p>One day Moxie came home to discover that his father was gone - no explanation, no clues, nothing. He waited, fishing and reading for a week before he asked after him in Rhymerock, to no avail. After some time, he left a letter at home and set out to find his father.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Druid, Rogue, Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Definitely good alignment of some variety. Speaks Draconic. If he should become a druid, he would be one of the coastal specialty. Moxie never set out with ambitions of saving the world; the whole reason he wandered away from his home in the cave in the sea cliffs in the first place was because he was looking for his father. If he were to get scent of Xiivairdaar's trail, he'd have to be up to his waist in something important not to follow it.</p>

				<h3>Mucksnipe</h3>
				<p>Mucksnipe was born to a mousy farmer's daughter in Arinya, a farming town just north of Baldur's Gate. His father was the voracious marauder Whitehog, a ravenous ogre who terrorized the neighborhood for most of a year before vanishing. He ate loads of people and raped Mucksnipe's mother, who died giving birth to him in a fountain of blood.</p>
				<p>His uncle slapped him with the name after deciding not to bash his head against a rock. Dispassionately, he knows that Mucksnipe's a nice boy, but there's nothing dispassionate about how he thinks of Mucksnipe. From a young age, he made sure the half-ogre knew who his father was, what Mucksnipe's father did to his mother, what Mucksnipe did to his mother, and how close his uncle came to ridding the world of him for it. A lifetime of being subjected to this story filled the simple-minded Mucksnipe with shame, to the point where he couldn't bear to look at people and was prone to fits of self-loathing rage.</p>
				<p>He got a second job in his midteens playing bouncer at The Copper Crab, the tavern on the halfling side of town. Bree Tealeaf, a halfling priestess of Sheela took him under her wing after, eventually sheltering him from his abusive family. Her husband Roscoe was a hunter, and in their modest manor, they succeeded in partially rehabilitating his shame into determination to protect people.</p>

				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Barbarian, Ranger, Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: I would go chaotic for this character, probably chaotic good. Being an uneducated half-ogre, Mucksnipe is not a rocket scientist, so intelligence should be his lowest stat. If he goes the route of the ranger, he should take ogres as his favored enemy. Either way, I have a mental image of his foster mother's influence in his choice of weapon, the scythe. There is nothing that would bring Mucksnipe as much satisfaction as relieving Whitehog's shoulders of his head. If Whitehog were to reappear in the world, Mucksnipe would make a beeline for his father's new stomping grounds meaning to do some stomping of his own.</p>

				<h3>Ronan Brandywine</h3>
				<p>Itmenixen was a red dragon who meant to raise a battalion of half-dragon children, and to this end he abducted female royals and noblewomen, raped them, and then ransomed them for mountains of gold after they gave birth. He lost interest in this plan and sold his children into slavery. An Orog warchief saw potential in Deevdrudiixen, a young male. He taught the half-dragon the ways of magic, and eventually the boy surpassed his master, joined up with the cult of Tiamat, had a baby through magical means, bailed on the mother, who raised him in the cult and abandoned him when he was five or so. From that point he made his way in the slums, an angry boy with a bright mind, working and sleeping in stables and kitchens, finding his way to the library when he had time.</p>
				<p>Ronan has a devil-may-care attitude and a zest for life, but if truth were to be told, he's deeply insecure, wounded by the multiple rejections of his forebears. He has a world-class chip on his shoulder and has a bone to pick with his parents, his grandfather, chromatic dragons in general, the cult of Tiamat, and the queen of dragons herself.</p>
				<p>He has some peculiar draconic traits. Like most red dragons, he has a thing for human and elven maidens, though this manifests itself in a heightened sex drive instead of dietary preference. But the most distinctive draconic trait is his desire to acquire treasure. He  talks a lot about acquiring an estate; this is partially for status, but mostly because he wants a place to hoard finery, trophies, and gold.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Wizard, Sorceror (Draconic), Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Definitely a chaotic type; probably not evil, but not by much. His vices are partially an outlet for his emotional injuries, so the only way I could see him becoming good is if he tackled the inferiority complex that rejection instilled in him. Though he is more or less human, bright red hair and irises would be a nice allusion to his biological grandfather. His extra language would be Draconic. If I were to roll amazing stats on this character, I would ask the DM to consider trading in a share of them to apply the half-dragon template to Ronan.</p>

				<h3>Sk&aacute;ri</i></h3>
				<p>This young man had the rare blessing of being raised on the Whalebone Islands, a human society where being a half-orc bastard was incidental; all they care for is bravery and diligence, and while his temper occasionally got him in trouble, he had friends and was well-thought of. His mother, Ylfva, a loving but severe woman, had him earning his keep as an assistant to Jakop the undertaker, at least when he wasn't earning his keep in their roots garden. It's hard to farm in the chilly, windy Whalebones, but the potatoes and carrots they grew were reliable and kept them fed.</p>
				<p>He was into his teenage years when one of the cadavers on Jakop's slabs sat up and ripped the undertaker's throat open. Sk&aacute;ri put the zombie down, but it was too late for his friend. He was disturbed by the emptiness of Jakop's demise. Katerin, a priestess of the Raven Queen, took him under her wing and taught him the balance and order that death brought to the world, that death was nothing to resent, fear, or to deal out lightly.</p>
				<p>Fascination crystalized into conviction as he internalized Katerin's stories and eventually took the vows of fealty to the Raven Queen, swearing to protect people, put down undead, and punish malicious hubris. Growing too big for home, Sk&aacute;ri got on a ship and set sail for the mainland.</p>
				<p class="note">Suggested Classes: Paladin (The Raven Queen), Cleric (The Raven Queen), Barbarian, Fighter</p>
				<p class="note">Notes: Sk&aacute;ri is aware that half-orcs aren't widely embraced outside of his home, but he may not be prepared for the reality of those prejudices. Taking into account his orcish temper and the fact that he's accustomed to being evaluated fairly, this dynamic may queue him up for some explosive confrontations. Being a follower of the Raven Queen, Sk&aacute;ri is lawful. Probably good. Necessarily good, if he's a paladin. Like the goddess of death he serves, Sk&aacute;ri reserves a special hatred for the undead and other scions of Orcus.</p>
