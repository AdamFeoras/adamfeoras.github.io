<p>To my dearest, baddest mom,</p>

<p>You are one the very best people I know and it's been such a good thing for you to be part of the story of my life. I love you with all my heart.</p>

<p>I always smile whenever I think of you and I pretending to be wacky muppets from Sesame Street, partly because I think it's funny, but mostly because I'm picturing my sisters and father looking at us like they're debating whether or not to check us into the funny farm. I've been blessed and cursed &ndash; blursed, one might say &ndash; with the Fleischmann sense of humor. Not sure what I would've done if I'd been the only one.</p>

<p>Something else that's been so good is your love of affection. Everyone else in the family has to be coerced into hugs, but it's so nice that you like that or I think I might have starved to death. A bear hug and a back scratch really take the edge of a lousy day. Actually they make good days better, too.</p>

<p>I saw something once that said, "Everyone thinks their mom's cooking is the best. They are all right." That is incorrect. They are all <i>wrong</i>. Only <i>I</i> am right. The person I know who's best at cooking chicken is a vegetarian &ndash; which is like winning the UFC Championship with one hand tied behind your back. If that doesn't say it, I'm not sure how to put your culinary supremacy into words.</p>

<p>In conclusion, here is a picture of you in your true, spirit form.</p>

<p>Love,<br/>Matt</p>
