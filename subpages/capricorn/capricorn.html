	<h2>Il medico</h2>
		Stepping into the doctor's nook, you are overwhelmed by the complex and vaguely pleasant miasma of smells. <br/>

		The doctor wears the otherworldly medico della peste, a carryover from the nightmare of the Black Death, a full-headed mask with a long, curved beak and big, round, soulless glass eyes tinted very dark red. His tone is unsettlingly deadpan, but he has a sympathetic touch and has been known to treat the poor gratuito – a good man.<br/>

		if (player.hit_points = player.max_hit_points){<br/>
			The doctor sits you down on his exam table. He listens to your heart with his apparatus, he feels your lymph nodes for swelling. He pats your arm. “Si è sani, signore. You have no need of my services.” You reach for your coin purse, but he waves you away as he goes back to his desk.<br/>
		}<br/><br/>
		else if (player.bloodied = true){
			The doctor lights a few candles and places them by mirrors around the exam table. “Try to relax, signore.” Over the next several minutes, the doctor works his suture needle in and out of your wounds. When he ties off your stitches, he washes them thoroughly with warm water. Then he grinds the peels from poppy stalks to a fine powder in a pestel and mixes it with honey, making a bittersweet-smelling plaster that he applies to the red lips of your closed injuries. “There you are,” he says, washing his hands in his copper basin. “Please take care not to stress the wounds. They need to heal.” You gingerly ease off the table and pay him + 40+2d8 + florins.<br/>
			player.hit_points = player.hit_points + 4+1d3<br/>

		}<br/>
		else{<br/>
			He takes your temperature with the back of his hand. “You have a slight fever. Maybe an infection.” He walks to his glass cabinet and pulls out a vial of thick brown oil. “Drink this. Sooner rather than later.” You break the wax seal and uncork the vial of strong, herbal smelling oil and swallow it down. You thank the doctor and pay him 20+1d8 florins for his help.<br/>

		<h2>Matteo's place</h2>
			Matteo runs his ship tight as a harp string. His cousins, the brothers Rocco and Carlo, lean up against either side of the door. When the authorities need someone lifted from the Granchio, they don't get them themselves, ever; they go to Matteo, who decides whether or not to tell Rocco and Carlo to toss the offender into the waiting hands of the authorities outside. Don't pick a fight and don't make a mess, and if you break one of his custom-made Venetian glass steins, he'll have you dumped in the harbour. Simply put, this place is exactly as nice to you as you are to it.<br/>
			“Salute, Matteo.”<br/>
			He looks up and smiles. “Domenico. Che piacere vederti. What can I get for you?”<br/>
			“Ho fame. What's on the menu today?”<br/>
			“Karina made some “ + room.menu_item + “. It's good.”<br/>
			They've been eating their wheaties, and their network of scars and surly expressions let you know they've been on the naughty list for quite some time. <br/>
			Captain X scowls. “Merda. Who told you about that?”<br/>
			“Matteo.”<br/>
			“Oh.” His face relaxing. “Capisco. Then you can help me.”<br/>
			if (player.alignment < - 29){<br/>
			Carlo puts a steady but unmovable hand on your chest. “Mi dispiace, Domenico. I'm sorry. You can't come in here when you're a wanted man. It's bad for business, amico.”<br/>
			You start to protest, but shut your mouth and turning, ease off the threshhold.<br/>

<p>There's two integer variables that space out episodes. One tracks how many days it's been since an episode, and another tracks how many days minimum between episodes. Every time you complete an episode, the first integer resets to zero and the second integer is determined by (DiceRoll("2d4")+7). Every time you sleep, the integer increments by one. Then a script runs to see if an episode should be started.</p>

<b>The Lord of Thunderstorms<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> All episode categories cleared</i><br/>
Zeus has taken an interest in your woman. He's also taken an interest in the discontinued existence of [sea monster], and claims that if you can provide the latter, he'll waive his need of the former.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Professional Angler<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 4, Strength 4</i><br/>
Slamming steel into steel, tying a knot hard enough to break bone, wrestling sea creatures twice your size into a boat with little to no leverage. You can only be a sailor for so long before your body becomes of thing of corded steel. You are shockingly strong.<br/>
<b><i>Reward:</b> You have advantage on all strength checks.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Free Diver<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 4, Constitution 4</i><br/>
Holding your breath for several minutes at a time, up and down, getting exercise and rewarding your body with fruits de mer, your body is built to hold up against extenuating conditions.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Shark Wrangler<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 4, Dexterity 4</i><br/>
You've tangled with so many baddies and beasties over the course of your career, that you seem to know right where the next blow will come from before they even cock their arm back. Getting the upper hand on you is so hard it's funny.<br/>
<b><i>Reward:</b> You have advantage on all dexterity checks.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Marine Biologist<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 4, Wisdom 4</i><br/>
How do sharks hunt in murky water? Why does drinking seawater dehydrate you? Where do shells come from? How do cuttlefish change color? You hoard knowledge, driven by a voracious need to understand the world around you.<br/>
<b><i>Reward:</b> You have advantage on all intelligence checks.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Former Castaway<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 4, Intelligence 4</i><br/>

<b>Dreadnought<br/>

<br/>
<b>Duellist<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 3, Strength 3, Wisdom 3</i><br/>
It's not so much hitting them hard, or hitting them fast, as hitting them right. When you're squaring with your enemy, you don't lash out. You study the way they move, the way their armor is constructed, and apply your years of experience to utterly sunder them.<br/>
<b><i>Reward:</b> Every time a human enemy takes damage from you, their armor class falls by 1.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Sea Wolf<br/>

<br/>
<b>Man o' War<br/>

Pain makes most people panic. Not you. If anything, it makes you angry, strong, more focused. <br/>

<br/>
<b>Bluejacket<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 3, Constitution 3, Intelligence 3</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Jolly Roger<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 3, Dexterity 3, Charisma 3</i><br/>
You're an infuriating bastard. Always dancing around your opponent's blade, cheerfully toying with them. Their attempts to kill you merely amuse you, which enrages them. <br/>
<b><i>Reward:</b> When a human enemy misses, your armor class increases by +1.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Oceanographer<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 3, Wisdom 3, Intelligence 3</i><br/>
You know these waters. Actually, you know most waters. Come to think of it, you just know water.<br/>
<b><i>Reward:</b> Nautical endeavors take 1 less hour to complete</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Round Robin<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 3, Wisdom 3, Charisma 3</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Tactician<br/>
<i>Prerequisites:</b> Saltiness 3, Intelligence 3, Charisma 3</i><br/>
Through extensive trial and error, you know exactly how to arrange your posse to ensure the other guys become pincushions.<br/>

	<div id="alignment" style="display:none;">
	Demonic (-235–), Monstrous (-234 – -115), Evil (-114 – -55), Cruel (-54 – -25), Naughty (-24 – -10), Neutral (-9 – 9), Nice (10 – 24), Kind (25 – 54), Good (55 – 114), Saintly (115 – 234), Angelic (235+)<br/>
	<br/>
	<h2>Meaningless Gestures</h2>
	Some things are so insignificant that they only effect a tiny change in your alignment, and even then only if the act in question goes against the grain of your current alignment score.<br/>
	For example, praying, giving food to cats, giving one florin to a beggar:<br/>
	if (alignment < -whatever){<br/>
		alignment = alignment + 1<br/>
	}<br/>
	Counter example, visiting a brothel;<br/>
	if (alignment > whatever){<br/>
		alignment = alignment – 1<br/>
	}<br/>
	<h2>Standard Expressions</h2>
		alignment = alignment + 1<br/>
		alignment = alignment – 1<br/>
	<h2>Meaningful Acts</h2>
		alignment = alignment + 5<br/>
		alignment = alignment – 5<br/>
	<h2>Huge Acts</h2>
	Some things are so big that they will change your alignment dramatically; if it goes against the grain of your current alignment score, it will change your alignment by a full level.<br/>
	For example, taking advantage of a drunk woman, killing innocent merchants to get at their stock:<br/>
	if (alignment > 50){<br/>
		[reduces your alignment score by a whole level]<br/>
	}<br/>
	else {<br/>
		alignment = alignment – 50<br/>
	}<br/>
	Counter example, coming to the aid of merchants in danger:<br/>
	if (alignment < -50){<br/>
		[increases your alignment score by a whole level]<br/>
	}<br/>
	else {<br/>

	Should holding your breath for max time increase saltiness?
	Should befriending a sea turtle and/or octopus increase saltiness?
	It's too easy to earn wisdom and constitution on a dive
	
	In your search of the shallows, you come across an interesting arrangement of stones. These disk-shaped stones are arranged in a circle, with larger, more distinctly shaped stones in seemingly random places within the circle. Is this a measuring or counting system? Maybe a game of some kind? Whatever it's meant to be, it's not a naturally occurring formation, so who put it here?
	
	You head for a deeper area of the shallows and spot something interesting on the blue bottom. Taking a deep breath at the surface, you commit yourself all the way down. It's a fish carcass, butchered, as in the way a human would. Curious. There aren't people nearby aside from you. You're about to reach for it when you note a blacktip has been drawn in by the scent, so you leave it. Best not to get in between a dog and his bone.
	
	You strap the sword around your waist, cinching it extra tight; you want to know exactly where to put your hand if the day takes an interesting turn.
	You undo your sword belt and put it on the ground.
	You take the dagger with you. Always good to have a smaller blade handy.
	You spend a couple of minutes pulling yourself into the beautiful silk outfit, and a few more seconds squaring the mantle so that it doesn't hang loose off either shoulder.
	You take off the Florentine silk and crushed velvet, carefully fold it, and lay it on the ground.
