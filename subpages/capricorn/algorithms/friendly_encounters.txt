A sea turtle cruises along several meters away.

Plucking a juicy handful of greenery, you swim over and offer it to her. She pulls inside her shell, wary at first, before ducking out and taking the tidbits. You amuse yourself for several minutes, finding her morsels around the shallows, and pretty soon she starts following you around and seems a bit dismayed when you head back up to the beach.
