				<p>Welcome, thank you for the visit. I've recently moved from the land of beer and pines to the land of wine and redwoods seeking employment and a forever home, and have christened that move with a new website.</p>
				<p>I love the creative outlet that technical writing affords me, though it wasn't what I first set out to do. I got my master's in middle school education in 2010 and spent a couple of years student teaching and subbing. It was an interesting experience, seeing the classroom from the other side, but I decided to pursue a career in computers instead.</p>
				<!--<p>When I design a web page, I try to cultivate an aesthetic that is strong and unique, but doesn't overwhelm the user or impede functionality. I don't use a CMS; I prefer to do things by hand, that way I know every single line of markup and code and where it is. It takes longer but I'm always happy with the results.</p>-->
				<p>Sometimes I work hard on coding all day as a project takes on a life of its own. Sometimes I drink wine and walk on the beach. Sometimes I pick my dog's poop off the ground. I'm versatile.</p>
				<p>I want to become a technical writing rockstar. I look forward to an exciting future, though I've got plenty on my plate right now, improving my skill set. But eventually I'd like to settle down, build a house, and publish a book.</p>
				<p>In addition to being a technical writer, I'm also a web developer, a reader, a writer, a hiker, a hunter, a beachcomber, a cook, an insomniac, a dog person, and a straight ally.
				<p>I always like to meet new people. I like to get commissions, too. So don't hesitate to contact me.</p>

					<h4>Spain</h4>
					<p>I made a website for Portugal.com's Spain packages. This was a painstaking but very fun project that demanded extensive research, creative writing, and artistic formatting. I wore many hats (all of them, really) and provided ongoing support for months. Out of the large projects I've done, this is my favorite and I get a little nostalgic when I visit it.</p>

					<h4>Keenai</h4>
					<p>Setting up this blog for Keenai was a fun and deceptively simple project. Working with them was a pleasure and I enjoyed building something so elegant.</p>

					<h4>CatalystCreativ</h4>
					<p>This is how I learned to use SquareSpace - and FAST. This came across my desk and represents the highest work/time ratio I've ever gotten on a contract, but I was very pleased with the result and so was the client, and I think you'll be impressed too. Ah, the magic of a deadline.</p>

					<h4>Capricorn</h4>
					<p>I'm coding one of those old-school text-based adventure games that were all the rage when I was a kid. But THIS one is special; I'm including variables that make the experience wildly unpredictable. These variables will make the circumstances, available tools, antagonists, and potential outcomes different every time you play through the game.</p>
					<p>Domenico is a former merchant who has stepped out of retirement following the death of his wife and is dabbling in illicit maritime activities. The late fifteenth century Amalfi Coast is beautiful, but capricious.</p>
					<p>I'm still developing it, crunching code, adding a feature, crunching code, adding a feature. In the meantime I've posted a simplified sandbox version that you can play right in your browser. <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/tqqz6mdockkyoy_oskxxeg/capricorn" target="blank">Click here to have a look.</a></p>

					<h4>The Tavern</h4>
					<p>I picked up Dungeons & Dragons in early 2016, and it was a heck of a thing in so many ways. I think it's more fun for experienced players (and more convenient for grown adults) to play episodic adventures. This Planescape setting I've homebrewed is meant to provide a very flexible game that can be run by multiple dungeon masters.</p>
					<p>I'm continuing to tweak it, add new ideas, new parameters, new prompts, new characters, but an experienced DM could take off with what's already here. Speaking of experience, the freedom of the Tavern is best enjoyed by veteran players who know what to do with it.<!--<a href="freebies/matthew_boddy_resume.pdf" target="blank">Click here to have a look.</a>--></p>

					<h4>Effenmont</h4>
					<p>I'm doing a mock-up of a website for the Sims neighbourhood I'm building as though it were a travel destination. I significantly elaborated on the design from my senior project and threw in some photo edits as well, but the inner workings are very different. I'm going to add a searchable database for the purpose of demonstrating MySql some time in the near future.</p>
					<p>I've been meaning to make a custom neighbourhood for years, and I'm coming at it like a professional. Those simmers that have gotten around to playing The Sims Medieval will recognize Effenmont as one of the nations you can send envoys to, trade with, and possibly lock horns with.</p>
					<p>In the meantime, I'm making a website to market the neighbourhood, in so far as you can market something you're not technically selling. I will associate my PayPal account with it, though. <a href="subpages/effenmont/simshome.html" target="blank">Click here to have a look.</a></p>

					<h4>YouTube Channel</h4>
					<p>A buddy of mine has the idea to set up a YouTube channel. He wants to film thoughtful reaction videos and I have a few ideas myself. If we muster two thousand subscribers, give or take, we'll try to get put on local tv. Really good exposure, especially in northern California.</p>
					<p>My dad also mentioned to me that you can monetize your YouTube account now. The other day I was looking at a guy who did a 70-part walkthrough of GTA5. One part had 2.1 million views. That's pretty inspiring.</p>
					<p>I don't see myself contriving a video game series. I don't think. I have some ideas, though.</p>

					<h4>Boss Monster</h4>
					<p>This is what happens when nerds make a classic party game with a retro theme. This is from Brotherwise Games, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">but I got ahold of their card creator</span> and they just released a legitimate alternative to what I was using and now I'm working on making a custom deck. I'm considering approaching Brotherwise when I'm done and offering to sell the material to them. If they don't bite, I'll put them on the internet for free and enjoy using them myself.</p>
					<p>I'm also using it to re-do a couple of their own cards that I want to tweak and a few of their cards that are now unavailable for retail.</p>

				<p>All self-respecting nerds know what the Konami Code is and a lot of them can probably name a website where its entry will make something special or funny happen. I was making a website for a security firm in early 2016, and on a whim cooked up this code and threw it in for kicks.</p>

				<h4>Ratatouille</h4>
				<p>I originally tried Ratatouille because the Pixar film got me curious. I wasn't disappointed. It's tasty, easy to make, good for you, and inexpensive to make a lot of. I like to make enough to feed the Weasley family, and then have one big bowl every day for several days.</p>

				<h4>Bouillabaise</h4>
				<p>My recipe for bouillabaise is more concerned with how you cook and season the dish and less with what specifically goes in it, although I personally am very fond of monkfish; it's perch between whitefish and lobster is *perfect* for this dish.</p>
				<h4>Crab Cakes</h4>

				<h4>Fisherman's Pie</h4>
